# async comprehension

This project contains tasks for learning to use asynchronous comprehensions in Python 3.

## Tasks
+ [x] 0. **Async Generator**<br/>[0-async_generator.py](0-async_generator.py) contains an asynchronous coroutine called `async_generator` that takes no arguments and meets the following requirements:
    + The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number 
    between 0 and 10. For the code below, make the following modifications:
    + Use the random module.
    + Use the Script below to testing the code. (save the script to file `0-main.py`)
  ```python3
     	 
  ```
